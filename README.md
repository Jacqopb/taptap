# taptap
BPM web app. Vanilla JS and no deps. On iOS, add to homescreen to get fullscreen support. 

`/public` hosted at https://taptap.lol

Supports any key down, mouse click and touch input to mark beat.

Automatically resets 1.5s after last beat input, so theoretically it supports down to 40bpm, but the practical limit is more like 50bpm (to avoid involuntary resets).

Developed as a christmas present to my wife (check the date of the first commit ;) for checking the tempo of songs to use in her https://www.friskissvettis.se/kalmar barbell workout class.
